This tool converts a directory of files into an arbitrarily ordered set using
lexicographically sortable integer file name prefixes.  For example, if itemize
is used on a directory containing "a.jpg, b.jpg, c.jpg", the files will be
renamed to "1_a.jpg, 2_b.jpg, 3_c.jpg"

Items can be added to the album at arbitrary positions.  The command "itemize
new.jpg -i 2" inserts a new file in the second position.  The new directory
listing will be "1_a.jpg, 2_new.jpg, 3_b.jpg, 4_c.jpg".  Items can also be added
with disjointed indicies: "1_a.jpg, 2_b.jpg, 3_c.jpg, 8_new.jpg"

Zeroes are padded to the front of file names if an incoming item causes the
largest item number to increase in digits (e.g. if the largest item number 
changes from 9 to 10, 1_a.jpg will become 01_.jpg)
